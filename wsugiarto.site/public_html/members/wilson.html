            <h2>Personal Infomration</h2>
            <p>Hi I am <b>Wilson</b>, a 20 year old college student from <i>Indonesia</i>. I currently study <em>Computer Science</em> as a rising senior at UCSD.
            I discovered my passion for creating software when I was introduced to tutorials on modding video games such as Minecraft, which also became my first
            computer science based project. Today, I still enjoy creating modifications for other software, but I have also developed a strong interest in recommender 
            systems and machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Current Project</h2>
            <h3>Music Generation Model</h3>
            <p>Use machine learning to generate music. Using <span id="span-example">LSTM models and markov chain models</span>, we were able to generate new pieces and continuations. </p>
            <aside>I particularly enjoy making extensions for <dfn>8 bit music</dfn>, which is a style of electronic music that uses the sound chips found 
                in early computers and video game consoles, as they are easy to train on and produce for the models.</aside>
